Likelihood-Expection-Recommendation
==================================

I am attempting to write a recommender using the yelp academic dataset given a userid by analyzing a user's reviews and attempt to guess with maximum likelihood what  a user will like (i.e a small list of restaurants)

Research Ideology
==================================
My idea in a nutshell is to turn a decent size set of reviews into a corpus and establish semantic similarity between the words in the corpus in order to recommend food based venues taking into consideration other factors.

Algorithmic Methodology
==================================
My approach to this problems the following main steps.
<ol>
<li>Bird</li>
<li>McHale</li>
<li>Parish</li>
</ol>
